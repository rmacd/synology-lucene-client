# synology-lucene-client

## Summary

This is a REST endpoint that permits the in-built Lucene++ index on Synology NAS instances to be queried remotely.

The output can then be consumed via eg [synology-lucene-client-ui](https://github.com/rmacd/synology-lucene-client-ui),
which permits the files to be queried and retrieved via the browser.

This is an alpha release. There are probably issues with threading and deadlocks. Caveat emptor.

## Lucene file types: an intro

The Synology file index service creates a bunch of files under `/<volume>/<share/@eaDir/SYNO@.fileindexdb`. Poking 
around the files tells you these are generated by Lucene++ (v3.0.7 on my system). A summary of these file types 
can be found below; taken from https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/fileformats.html:

| Name                  | Extension                | Brief Description                                                                                                       |

[Luke 4.3.0](https://github.com/DmitryKey/luke/releases?page=4) can be used to read the Lucene++ indices. With that,
we can extract the fields within the Lucene++ index. I've mapped them across as follows (note last column, where
I've tried to describe what is stored within these fields):

# Deploying
 
The REST API provides two endpoints: `/search` (for performing the search), and `/get` (for retrieving the doc).

## Overview

- Runs in Docker
- Exposes search interface on port `18080`

### Build locally

`docker build . -t synosearch`

### Configure

To find relevant paths within volumeX:

`find /volumeX -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -type d ! -name "@*"`

**important** do not deploy this version on any production system: the `/get` endpoint allows all documents to be
returned with no permissions checks, and there is no filtering currently applied to the search.

To run and expose a share `/volume1/dropbox`, execute as follows:

```
nas$> docker run -p 18080:18080 \
  -v /volume1/dropbox:/volume1/dropbox:ro \
  -v /volume1/dropbox/@eaDir/SYNO@.fileindexdb:/indices/dropbox:ro \
  synosearch -index /indices/dropbox
```

Then you should be able to hit the `/search` endpoint:

`curl "http://hostname:18080/search?q=example" | jq '.'`

This will then return search results as JSON:

```
{
  "hits": [
    {
      "path": "/volume1/dropbox/ExampleNotificationPlugin.java",
      "fs_size": 995,
      "score": 1.72329,
      "extension": "java"
    }
  ],
  "total_hits": 1
}
```

Then you can run the [synology-lucene-client-ui](https://github.com/rmacd/synology-lucene-client-ui) on top of this
to provide a friendly UI.
